					<h3>Belle Pastry is a company that provides desserts as their main products. The reason why we chose dessert as our products is because we 
                        strongly believe that people tend to look for desserts as it is a must after having a full meal course. We offer a variety of desserts that 
                        are able and appealing to attract customers in terms of physical and taste of the dessert. Our cafes are a hybrid business as we not only provide 
                        desserts online, but we also provide delivery and cash on delivery to ensure customers of all ages and occupations are able to enjoy our delectable desserts. 
                        We also openly welcome our customers who prefer walking in through our cafes to enjoy freshly baked desserts straight from the oven. </p>
